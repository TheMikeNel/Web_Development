      You are on my home page. To the north lies my blog, from whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large mountain, upon which many school papers are littered. Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me, desperately scribbling a thesis.
      To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled "games". Another more boring-looking exit is labeled ISPâ„¢.
      To the south lies a dark and dank contacts page. Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run quickly out of the page.
